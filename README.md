In this project, we have determined the level of illumination for different lighting conditions. The result was less accurate during the daytime for the interference of daylight. But during the night time, we were able to determine the lux value somewhat precisely by using a flashlight and varying its brightness. The main application of Lux Meter is to accurately measure the light intensity. It has many indoor and outdoor applications which makes this a very important device. Modern mobile phones and photography devices have lux meter integrated in their hardwares.
